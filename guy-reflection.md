What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
 Admittedly, I had no real issues with git before this session, aside from perhaps creating a pull request ON github.
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
	The process of fetching and pulling, and the difference between the two were clarified here.
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
	I asked about the difference between fetching and pulling, and I asked for clarification about what pulling a file from github actually does.
What still confuses you about Git?
	We were sligtly confused on how to get a git merge conflict to show up - as you might be able to see we were unsuccessful in replicating that problem, so that might require a bit more clarification.
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
	It was really helpful, it was nice to work alongside another as someone was giving us just enough guidance needed to finish the project.
